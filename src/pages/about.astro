			Hi, Iâ€™m a starter Alex Hewitt. I am an experienced software developer who is passionate about
			learning new things constantly. Technologies that I use include:
			<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
				<li>Python</li>
				<li>React</li>
				<li>Javascript</li>
			</ul>
			<br />
			I also am seeking to learn React Native to start building some apps that I have in mind. On this
			personal website I plan to discuss things I am interested in or am working on!
